# Group-Spam-Detection-with-Machine-Learning-Deep-Learning-and-Natural-Language-Processing
The Project is about to find the spammer groups who are working for the same products to promote or demote it. I have applied different Machine learning, deep learning and Natural language processing techniques to detect the groups of spam people. The two datasets are used yelp and amazon. The cleaning part have been already done. I have put combined my all code in model.py file and can run through main.py and the separate files are also present.
